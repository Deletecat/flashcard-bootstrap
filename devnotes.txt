flashcarts that can be directly built:

- All DSTT-based clones
- GBA Movie Player (Compact Flash)
- iSmart Premium
- EZ-Flash V (SDHC is not tested. Some outdated sources suggest that EZV SDHC does not have SD card init, and thus cannot be booted from DLDI alone.)
- Original R4

flashcarts that have some protection built in
- Ace3DS+
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x4002
    - must use regular ds_arm9.ld and ds_arm7.ld to build (default one used in most DS projects)
- R4 i.L.S., all r4isdhc.com.cn carts, r4isdhc.hk carts dated 2020 or newer
    - build with ndstool with args `-g "XX" "XX" "R4XX"
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x4002
    - must use regular ds_arm9.ld and ds_arm7.ld (default one used in most DS projects)
- Gateway Blue (possibly R4infinity 2?)
    - build with ndstool with args `-g "XX" "XX" "R4IT"
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x4002
    - must use regular ds_arm9.ld and ds_arm7.ld (default one used in most DS projects)
- R4i-SDHC, r4isdhc.com 2014+ carts
    - has a hash checking watermark at every 0x200 bytes
    - problem is fincs's code is broken and doesn't seem to compile on any devkitARM version
        - so for now just have R4.dat from alternate_loaders and 'cp TTMenu.dat _boot_ds.nds`

flashcarts with a particular load address:
- all r4ids.cn carts, R4 Ultra and R4i Ultra
    - EWRAM entry (e9 entry address) must be 0x02000800
    - For some reason if you try to change this by setting CRT0 address in LDFLAGS this doesn't work. So a specs file is provided.
- Acekard 2, 2.1, 2i
    - EWRAM entry (e9 entry address) must be 0x02000450
- Wood r4igold.cc upgrade
    - Appears to be related to the Galaxy Eagle line?
    - EWRAM entry (e9 entry address) must be 0x02000000

flashcarts that require extra files
- M3 DS Real, R4RTS, iTouchDS, iTouch2, R4 SDHC RTS black
    - Any of these will launch /_system_/_sys_data/r4i.sys which is just a normal NDS file
    - all boot files are derived from the R4RTS loader, with different encryption keys
    - All thanks goes to Taiju Yamada, Rudolph and NDS Laboratory for tools and/or tips on getting this correct
    - R4RTS:
        - launches 'loader.eng', which launches /_system_/_sys_data/r4i.sys
    - R4 SDHC RTS black
        - launches /_DS_MENU.sys.
        - otherwise identical to R4RTS. No effort was put in here. Thanks r4isdhc.com team
    - M3 DS Real:
        - checks /SYSTEM/g6dsload.1, and launches /SYSTEM/g6dsloader.eng. 
        - g6dsload.1 is a very specific stub for now, not sure what its use is but it needs to be there, so for now I just used whatever the converter spewed out
    - iTouchDS, iTouch2
        - launches `boot.*` depending on region of cart. No easy way to identify, but they are all different encryption keys.
        - just check which one it is manually, it's 3 files anyway

random notes:
- MSHL2 writes 32KB of data, regardless of what your DLDI size is. This breaks a bunch of homebrew. You need to recompile libnds with 32KB DLDI size to fix.
- For some reason if you try to directly create the DSONE SDHC bootloader you don't get access to entire hardware. This breaks YSMenu.
    - thus, use the alternate loader, then copy something DSTT related to it, works.
    - I should try to get in contact with bliss...

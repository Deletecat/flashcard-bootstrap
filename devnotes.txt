flashcarts that can be directly built:

- All DSTT-based clones
- GBA Movie Player (Compact Flash)
- iSmart Premium
- EZ-Flash V (SDHC is not tested. Some outdated sources suggest that EZV SDHC does not have SD card init, and thus cannot be booted from DLDI alone.)
- Original R4

flashcarts that require a specialized tool
- M3DS Real
    - a tool by Rudolph named dsbize is required. dsbize source is in /tools. Compile it for PC then run `dsbize <rom name here> menu.xx 0x12`

flashcarts that require extra files
- R4RTS, iTouchDS, iTouch2
    - needs `loader.eng` or `boot.eng`, this launches /_system_/_sys_data/r4i.sys which is just a normal NDS file

flashcarts that have some protection built in
- Ace3DS+
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x4002
    - must use regular ds_arm9.ld and ds_arm7.ld to build (default one used in most DS projects)
- R4 i.L.S., all r4isdhc.com.cn carts, r4isdhc.hk carts dated 2020 or newer
    - build with ndstool with args `-g "XX" "XX" "R4XX"
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x4002
    - must use regular ds_arm9.ld and ds_arm7.ld (default one used in most DS projects)
- Gateway Blue (possibly R4infinity 2?)
    - build with ndstool with args `-g "XX" "XX" "R4IT"
    - encrypt using r4denc with 0x4002
    - must use regular ds_arm9.ld and ds_arm7.ld (default one used in most DS projects)
- all r4ids.cn carts
    - EWRAM entry (e9 entry address) must be 0x02000800
- R4 Ultra and R4i Ultra
    - EWRAM entry (e9 entry address) must be 0x02000800

flashcarts that can be directly built but also needs more info
- Acekard 2, 2.1, 2i
    - some funky entry address. For some reason breaks in TWiLight Menu++ but works here.

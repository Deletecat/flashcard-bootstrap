# Flashcard Bootstrap

This repository aims to have an easy replacement for your flashcart kernel to automatically boot any homebrew of your choice. 

This will simply launch `BOOT.NDS` homebrew on the root of the SD card.

Currently available flashcarts:
- DSTT (TTMenu.dat)
- EZ Flash V (ez5sys.bin)
- Original R4 (_DS_MENU.dat)
- Acekard 2, 2.1, 2i (akmenu4.nds)
- r4ids.cn carts, R4 Ultra (in r4ids.cn folder)
- Ace3DS+ (in ACEP folder)
- R4iLS, r4isdhc.com.cn, r4isdhc.hk (in R4iLS folder)
- M3 DS Real, M3i Zero (non-GMP-Z003), iTouchDS, iTouch2, R4(i)RTS (r4rts.com), R4 SDHC RTS black (in M3R_iTDS_R4RTS folder)

Copy the appropriate files to root, and then add any homebrew of your choice to root and rename it BOOT.NDS.
